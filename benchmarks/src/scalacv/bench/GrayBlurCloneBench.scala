/** Isolates the wasted clone in `Motion.prepare`'s already-grey + blur branch. The old shape cloned the
  * borrowed grey frame and then blurred the clone (the blur allocates its own destination and only borrows,
  * so the clone was freed unused); the new shape blurs the borrowed frame directly.
  *
  * Both produce bit-identical output — verified by pixel hash — so this measures exactly the cost of the
  * removed clone on the per-frame motion path.
  *
  * Run: `./mill benchmarks.runMain scalacv.bench.GrayBlurCloneBench`
