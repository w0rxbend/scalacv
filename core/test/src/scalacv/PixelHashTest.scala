/** The CI half of the project's perf rule — "no optimization without a bit-identical output hash" — for the
  * clone-elimination benchmarks. `GrayBlurCloneBench` removes the throwaway clone from `Motion.prepare`'s
  * already-grey + blur branch and blurs the borrowed frame directly, but it only *prints* the two pixel
  * hashes for a human to eyeball. Here they are asserted, so a change that makes the output differ — or makes
  * `gaussianBlur` destructive, which is what the removed clone was guarding against — fails the build.
  *
  * (The other bit-exact optimization, the translucent ROI alpha-blend, is gated by [[GraphicsAlphaRoiTest]].)
