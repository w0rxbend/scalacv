/** Tolerance-metric comparisons — PSNR and max-abs-diff — the cross-platform-robust alternative to the
  * bit-exact pixel hashes in [[PixelHashTest]]. Bit-exact equality is correct only same-platform; SIMD paths
  * and OpenCV-build differences break it, so a golden set that must survive a multi-OS/arch matrix has to
  * compare within a threshold. This suite exercises the metrics on a genuinely lossy path (JPEG roundtrip),
  * which by construction is never bit-exact, and pins the comparator behaviour so the infrastructure is ready
  * when the CI matrix grows (see docs/audit/03-correctness.md §7, 04-test-plan.md).
