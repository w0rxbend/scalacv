/** Reading, writing, encoding and decoding images — the boundary between OpenCV and everything else.
  *
  * This is the one place in the library where OpenCV's error reporting is genuinely inconsistent, and the
  * whole point of the object is to flatten that into a single `Either`. Two distinct failure shapes come out
  * of `org.opencv.imgcodecs.Imgcodecs`:
  *
  *   1. `imdecode` **never throws** for bytes that are not an image. It returns a `Mat` with
  *      `empty() == true` (and logs a `findDecoder` warning to stderr). Anyone who forgets the `empty()`
  *      check gets a `CvException` several call frames later, from an `Imgproc` operation that had nothing to
  *      do with the mistake.
  *   1. `imencode` **throws `CvException`** when the extension names no known encoder — so `haveImageWriter`
  *      is consulted first and that case is returned as [[CvError.EncodeFailed]] before the throw can happen,
  *      rather than being recovered from OpenCV's error text.
  *
  * Every function here returns `Either[CvError, ?]` covering both. The encode failures share the one
  * [[CvError.EncodeFailed]] type, so `case EncodeFailed(...)` catches them all.
  *
  * ==The file I/O is done by the JVM, not by OpenCV==
  * [[read]] and [[write]] do **not** call `imread`/`imwrite`. They open the file with `java.nio.file` and
  * leave OpenCV only the codec work, through [[decode]] and [[encode]]. The reason is the path. The JNI layer
  * narrows a Java `String` with `GetStringUTFChars`, so the native side receives modified UTF-8 bytes, and
  * OpenCV's imgcodecs hands those bytes straight to `fopen`. On Windows the C runtime interprets them in the
  * process's ANSI code page, so *any* non-ASCII character in the path resolves to a different, nonexistent
  * name: `imread` then returns an empty Mat and `imwrite` returns `false` — indistinguishable from "the file
  * is not there" and "the directory is not writable". Upstream has not fixed this (opencv#4292 is still open
  * in 4.13) and exposes no wide-character entry point to call instead. Reading and writing the bytes on the
  * JVM side avoids the narrowing altogether, and as a side effect lets both functions report *which* of the
  * causes they used to lump together actually happened.
  *
  * The price is that the encoded file passes through a JVM byte array: peak heap grows by its size, and a
  * file above 2 GB is out of reach, because `Files.readAllBytes` cannot return an array that long. Routing
  * around that with a memory-mapped buffer was rejected — `imdecode` needs a `MatOfByte` built from a JVM
  * array anyway, so the copy is not avoidable here.
  *
  * The same narrowing hazard applies to every other `String`-path native call in the library —
  * `VideoCapture`, `VideoWriter`, `CascadeClassifier.load`, `Dnn.readNet` — and none of those has an
  * in-memory equivalent to reroute through, so they remain ASCII-path-only on Windows.
  *
  * ==Ownership==
  * A returned [[Managed]]`[Mat]` is **caller-owned**: nothing else holds a reference and nothing else will
  * free it. Prefer `Images.read(p).map(_.use(...))` over holding one. Mats created internally — the
  * `MatOfByte` staging buffers, and the empty Mat a failed read hands back — are released here.

  /** Reads an image from the filesystem.
    *
    * The bytes are read by the JVM and only the decoding is left to OpenCV, via [[decode]]. `imread` is not
    * used at all; the object header says why, and what it costs.
    *
    * @param path
    *   a filesystem path, resolved by the JVM. It is not a classpath resource, a URL, or a glob.
    * @param flags
    *   how the decoded pixels are converted — colour, grayscale, unchanged, reduced size. Every
    *   [[ImreadFlags]] value means exactly the same thing to `imdecode` as it does to `imread`.

    *   names a directory, names an empty file, cannot be read, or holds bytes no registered decoder
    *   recognises. Which one it was is in the error's `details`: those causes used to be one message, because
    *   one empty Mat was all `imread` gave us to tell them apart. For the last case OpenCV still prints its
    *   own `findDecoder` warning to stderr and gives us no way to silence it.

    * an extension with no registered encoder, which is caught by asking `haveImageWriter` first rather than
    * letting `imencode` throw a `CvException`; a path this filesystem cannot represent; a missing parent
    * directory; and a destination that is not writable. The last two used to share one message, because
    * `imwrite` signalled both with a bare `false`.
    *
    * The receiver is not modified and not released.
