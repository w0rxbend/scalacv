/** Loads the OpenCV native libraries, without ever requiring a GUI toolkit.
  *
  * The obvious approach — `Loader.load(classOf[opencv_java])` — does not work on a headless machine. javacpp
  * eagerly initialises the whole preset graph, and `opencv_highgui` is GTK2-linked on Linux, so on a box
  * without GTK it throws and takes `objdetect`, `calib3d`, `features2d` and `video` down with it. `objdetect`
  * is precisely what this library needs most.
  *
  * `libopencv_java` itself links no GUI toolkit. So we bring javacpp up through a GUI-free preset, extract
  * the platform payload, and then load the JNI shim, resolving its dependencies **on demand** — see
  * [[satisfy]] for why loading them speculatively is not merely wasteful but unsafe. The result needs no
  * `apt-get install libgtk2.0-0t64` on any runner.

  /** Loads `target`, resolving its dependencies **on demand** from the extracted payload.
    *
    * The obvious approach — `dlopen(RTLD_GLOBAL)` every module library and let a retry loop sort out the
    * order — is actively dangerous, and it took a JVM crash to find out why. The bundled
    * `libopencv_highgui.so` carries *unversioned* `NEEDED` entries (`libopencv_core.so`, not
    * `libopencv_core.so.413`). Loading it makes the dynamic linker search the system path, and on a machine
    * that happens to have OpenCV installed it does not fail — it succeeds, mapping six `libopencv_*.so.5.0.0`
    * system libraries into the global namespace, where they interpose on our 4.13.0 symbols. The next call
    * that crosses between the two ABIs dies in `cv::Mat::release()` with no Java stack trace. Reproduced
    * exactly that way.
    *
    * So on Linux and macOS: never speculatively load a library. Try the JNI shim, read the soname out of the
    * `UnsatisfiedLinkError`, load *that* library from the payload, and try again. The shim asks only for what
    * it actually needs, which on Linux excludes highgui entirely and on macOS includes it — correct on both
    * without a platform conditional. And a dependency we cannot satisfy from the payload is a real error
    * rather than something the linker quietly resolves against whatever the host has lying around.
    *
    * Windows is the exception. Its `UnsatisfiedLinkError` is `Can't find dependent libraries` and names no
    * library, so the soname cannot be extracted and demand-driven loading has nothing to act on. There a bulk
    * retry-load is used instead — and it is *safe* there for the reason it is not on Linux: the Windows DLL
    * names embed the version (`opencv_core4130.dll`, not `opencv_core.dll`), so a bulk load cannot silently
    * bind a different major version's DLL from the system, and `opencv_highgui` links only the OS-provided
    * USER32/GDI32, which are always present. The bulk fallback is gated on the platform for exactly that
    * reason — see [[bulkLoadIsSafe]] — because "the message named no library" is *not* a Windows-only
    * condition: a cross-classloader conflict, an undefined symbol, a `noexec` cache mount or an architecture
    * mismatch all produce messages [[missingSoname]] cannot parse, on every platform.
    *
    * Throws the `UnsatisfiedLinkError` or a [[CvError.NativesMissing]] describing the first dependency it
    * cannot satisfy; off Windows an unparseable error is rethrown as-is rather than bulk-loaded around.
