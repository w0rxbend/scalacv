/** RSS-based leak assertions.
  *
  * Phase 6 of the memory audit proved that JavaCPP's `Pointer.totalBytes()` is **blind** to scalacv's
  * memory: a deliberate ~1.4 GB `org.opencv.core.Mat` leak moved it by 0 bytes, because those buffers are
  * allocated by OpenCV's own JNI (`cv::fastMalloc`) rather than through JavaCPP's tracked `Pointer`
  * allocators. So `totalBytes()` — and the `-Dorg.bytedeco.javacpp.maxBytes` budget derived from it —
  * cannot gate a scalacv leak. The only signal that sees these buffers is **process RSS**, read from
  * `/proc/self/statm` on Linux and falling back to `Pointer.physicalBytes()` (itself RSS-based) elsewhere.
  *
  * These assertions must run where their suite is the **only** one in the JVM (the dedicated `leaks`
  * module), because RSS is process-global and would otherwise be contaminated by concurrently-running
  * suites.
